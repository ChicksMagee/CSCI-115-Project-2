I did it solo. I started with a partner, but the partner did not do much so we split up. :/
Troy Samra - Created the README, Commented the code, Created the two levels, Did all player and enemy collision, did picking up arrows and shooting 
added custom textures, implemented shortest path using A*, wrote the 1 page report, did loading from a file, did multiple loading options, added some functionality to the player class.

The project is commented and compiles. 
All you have to do is hit build and run then pick which map you want to play lava or forest. 
**Make sure to click into the fullscreen game window after picking which level you want**
